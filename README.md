# 3d-Scanner
This program works as a driver software for a simple 3d scanner based off of the SuperMakeSomething build found at: https://github.com/SuperMakeSomething/diy-3d-scanner/blob/master/scannerCode.ino It has been designed to function on a Raspberry Pi rather than arduino, and writes the scan data to a local file rather than SD card. The build this code was designed around uses two 28BYJ-48 motors and ULN2003APG driver boards. The scanner is a Sharp GP2Y0A51SK0F. The rotate function here is a derivative of https://github.com/Basch3000/raspberry-pi-projects/blob/master/motordeg.py
